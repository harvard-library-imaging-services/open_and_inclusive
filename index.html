Most prominent is the Harvard Semitic Museum Photographic Archives, developed at the Semitic Museum between 1891 and 1992, and transferred to the FAL in 1995, comprising over 38,000 images in a wide variety of formats. Other Middle East collections include exceptional photographs by prominent 19th c. photography studios such as Maison Bonfils and Antonio Beato. Félix Bonfils and his wife Lydie (1837-1918) came from Saint Hippolyte du Fort in the Gard. As a binder, then a printer, and finally a photographer trained by Niépce de Saint Victor, Félix Bonfils stayed in Lebanon in 1860 during France’s military expedition. He soon decided to transfer his activity there, and so Bonfils’s photographic studio was founded in Beirut in 1867. Bonfils was not a pioneer photography, yet he was the first Frenchman to open a studio in Beirut. His wife, soon assisted by their son Adrien (1861-1929), produced portraits and genre scenes as they travelled throughout Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, Turkey and Greece before bringing back their shots. The Bonfils studio was above all renowned for its landscapes, sites and views of architecture made first of all for artists, wealthy travellers, art historians and archaeologists, then for an increasing number of tourists.<br />[Largest image in DRS: 3948 x 3001]</br><br />

Until the arrival of ‘Raja Deen Dayal’, British photographers expressly dominated the medium. He photographed the site of Ellora, in Maharashtra, which is famous for its series of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples excavated into the rocky façade of a cliff of basalt. The works were done under the patronage of the Kalachuri, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta dynasties between the sixth and the ninth centuries. The group of the so-called Dherwada caves represents the southernmost group of the Buddhist caves, and dates back to the sixth century.

Her novels can perhaps best be described as impressionistic, a literary style which attempts to inspire impressions rather than recreating reality. She was acquainted with the Bloomsbury Group, a collection of artists and writer intellectuals. Leonard Woolf was among them, and the two wed in 1912.
The couple moved around a bit, but in 1919 they discovered the place that would eventually become their permanent residence. Known as Monk’s House, the garden and cottage served as the couple’s home as well as the meeting places for people connected to the Bloomsbury Group, including notable authors like T.S. Eliot and E.M. Forster. Woolf chronicled her time at Monk’s House through photographs—from her everyday life to visitors of the house. <br />[Largest image in DRS: 4098 x 5535]</br><br />

He also used photography in innovative ways to document the Athenian Acropolis.Stillman undertook to photograph the monuments on the Acropolis. A selection of twenty-five photographs was published in London in 1870 as The Acropolis of Athens Illustrated Picturesquely and Architecturally in Photography. Stillman's photographs are unlike others produced at that time. His amateur status freed him from the professional's obligation to make pictures that conformed to a buyer's expectations. He could therefore explore unexpected angles and points of view on the Acropolis.<br />[Largest image in DRS: 3903 x 3138]</br><br />

Although raised in Montreal, he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, and never returned home. He began a Grand Tour in 1827, climbed Mont Blanc, then visited Naples, where he became part of a social and diplomatic set there that included such visitors as Walter Scott and Edward Bulwer-Lytton. He remained in or near Naples the rest of his life.

In 1831, Auldjo visited Mt Vesuvius, which was then in a moderately active state. He took his sketchpad along, and soon thereafter wrote an illustrated account of his adventures. This image shows a small lava cone in the Vesuvius crater, with Auldjo holding a handkerchief over his nose to thwart the fumes, probing at the lava with his hiking staff<br />[Largest image in DRS: 4212 x 2672]</br><br />

“The women were challenged to make sense of these patterns by devising a scheme for sorting the stars into categories. Annie Jump Cannon's success at this activity made her famous in her own lifetime, and she produced a stellar classification system that is still in use today. Antonia Maury discerned in the spectra a way to assess the relative sizes of stars, and Henrietta Leavitt showed how the cyclic changes of certain variable stars could serve as distance markers in space.”[3]

Among these women were Williamina Fleming, Annie Jump Cannon, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Florence Cushman and Antonia Maury. Although these women started primarily as calculators, they made significant contributions to astronomy, much of which they published in research articles.

Henry Hamilton (1734?-1796) was a British army officer in the American Revolutionary War. He was also Lieutenant-Governor and Governor of Detroit, Quebec, Bermuda, and Dominica.
The collection includes Hamilton's drawings of Native Americans of the Upper Great Lakes, including Canada. These drawings are considered to be the earliest and largest collection of life portraits of Native Americans from this region. Includes individuals of the nations of: Wyandot-Huron, Miami, Ottawa, Ojibwa, and others.Through Hamilton's annotated drawings as well as his manuscript journals, "a positive evaluation of Native American character and culture emerges which contradicts the stereotype of the imperious British officer. He maintained a healthy curiosity and strove for an objective, scientific view of the alien culture. Nowhere is this better seen than in his unofficial recordings of Native American life and character and especially in this collection of portrait drawings.<br />[Largest image in DRS: 4025 x 6192]</br><br />

Formally begun in the 1890s by William Morris Davis, a professor in the Geology Department from 1876–1912, the collection was later named for George Augustus Gardner, who gave a substantial gift for the purchase of photographs for geological instruction.

The photographs provide an important visual account of how the landscape changed from the late 1880s through the 1910s. They were taken by several important photographers of the day, including Seneca Ray Stoddard, Nathaniel Livermore Stebbins, and Baldwin Coolidge.

</a>;[comstock: I believe this <strong>visual collection</strong> is cited as one of the first to have been collected explicitly as a teaching aid.

Parkinson was a Scottish botanist and natural history artist employed by Joseph Banks on Captain James Cook's first Endeavor voyage to the Pacific from 1768-1771. The drawing was then engraved in John Hawkesworth's Voyages (an account of the journeys by Captain Cook, Vice Admiral John Byron, and Joseph Banks published on behalf of the Admirality in 1773). Captain Cook (1728-1779) made three separate voyages to the Pacific (with the ships Endeavour, Resolution, Adventure, and Discovery) and did more than any other voyager to explore the Pacific and Southern Ocean. Cook not only encountered Pacific cultures for the first time, but also assembled the first large-scale collections of Pacific objects to be brought back to Europe. He was killed in Hawaii in 1779. War canoes, according to Joseph Banks, were judged to hold over 60 people.<br />[Largest image in DRS: 6668 x 2569]</br><br />

The photographer Andrés Romero Spethman worked alongside muralist brigades representing political parties such as the Partido Socialista and the Izquierda Cristiana. Created in and around Santiago between 1983 and 1990, the murals document the spirit, force, and iconography of political protest during an important period of Chilean history.
